# React: Dinamic Applications:

Transitioning from building static websites with HTML and CSS to developing dynamic applications with React can be a big shift due to the way React structures its components and manages data. Let's break down how React works in a simplified way, which should help to understand the file structure and component system better.

## Core Concepts of React
### 1. Components:
* React applications are built using components. These components are reusable and independent pieces of code that represent a part of the user interface (UI). Each component can have its own layout (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).

* Components can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page. Typically, you write components in files such as TodoCard.jsx, TodoInput.jsx, and TodoList.jsx.

### 2. JSX:
* JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It's used in React to describe what the UI should look like. Each React component will typically return JSX code that defines a portion of the UI.

* JSX allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript, making it easier to create and manage complex UIs.
