# React: Dinamic Applications:

Transitioning from building static websites with HTML and CSS to developing dynamic applications with React can be a big shift due to the way React structures its components and manages data. Let's break down how React works in a simplified way, which should help to understand the file structure and component system better.

## Core Concepts of React
### 1-Components:
*React applications are built using components. These components are reusable and independent pieces of code that represent a part of the user interface (UI). Each component can have its own layout (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).
*Components can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page. Typically, you write components in files such as TodoCard.jsx, TodoInput.jsx, and TodoList.jsx.
